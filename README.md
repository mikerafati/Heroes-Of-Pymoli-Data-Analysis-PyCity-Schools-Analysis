# PyCity Schools Analysis
* As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually (\\$645-675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (&lt;\\$585 per student).

* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. 
the purpose from this project:
1)Calculate the Totals (Schools and Students).
2)Calculate the Total Budget.
3)Calculate the Average Scores.
4)Calculate the Percentage Pass Rates.
5)Determine the School Type.
6)Calculate the average test scores.
for Visualization
*)Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate).  Sort and show top five schools and show bottom five schools
*)Math Scores by Grade(Create data series of scores by grade levels)
*)Scores by School Spending(Categorize the spending based on the bins)
*)Scores by School Size
